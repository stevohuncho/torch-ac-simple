# torch-ac-simple
A simpler way to train and evaluate your Minigrid agents. This project is built on top of [torch-ac](https://github.com/lcswillems/torch-ac?tab=readme-ov-file), thus all training/eval functionality are similar. For further information on how to configure you model refer to [torch-ac's documentation](https://github.com/lcswillems/torch-ac?tab=readme-ov-file) and this [playground project](https://github.com/lcswillems/rl-starter-files) similarly built upon `torch-ac`.

# Installation

pip install torch_ac_simple
